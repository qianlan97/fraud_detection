### Outline
The project consists of file scripts, together with utility functions inside the file folder ```libs```, and dataset from file folder ```https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RFZRGtof-Y1xujf7GTjHPbgfYmQuVJBr?usp=sharing ```.

### Dependencies
+ **Programming Tools**: *Python* and *Jupyter Notebook*
+ **Libraries**: *imblearn*, *sklearn*, *Keras*, *matplotlib*, *graphviz* and *pandas*

### How to run the scripts
The file folder libs consists of multiple utility functions to draw the ROC and PR curves.
Before running the script, it is extremely important to **extract corresponding function py files from the child lib folder and place these lib functions files 
under the same folder path with other scripts.**
The output will be automatically saved to current folder or printed out during runtime.


### Paper and Code connection
In electronic pdf paper file, every link is connected to the corresponding script file which can retrieve and reproduce the results from the paper.
