### How to run the scripts
The file folder libs consists of multiple utility functions to draw the ROC and PR curves.
Before running the script, it is extremely important to **extract corresponding function py files from the child lib folder and place these lib functions files 
under the same folder path with other scripts.**
The output will be automatically saved to current folder or printed out during runtime.

### Outline
The project consists of file scripts, together with utility functions inside the file folder ```libs```, and dataset from file folder.

```RF_new_local.ipynb```: random forest

```decision_tree_grid_search.py```: decision tree

```distribution.py```: preprocessing distribution

```k_nearest_neighbour.ipynb```: KNN

```preprocessing_comparision.ipynb```: SMOTE performance

### Dependencies
